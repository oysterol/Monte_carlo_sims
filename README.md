# Monte_carlo_sims
MOntecarlo simulations to simulate a forest fire and a pandemic, spawn rate of trees and forest size can be changed. plotted to find a critical value.
Same for pandemic, but imunity, infection change and different pathogens(mutation chances) can be added.(can probably include dying individuals to to simulate a leathal situation), is currently on a grid
can possibly be changed to a particle in a box (multiple boxes) to simulated cities,
